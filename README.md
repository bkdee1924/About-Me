# Hi, I'm  Deekshit Kumar! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
Blending over 6+ years of experience as IT professional, including 1+ years as a Data Scientist. My career began as a Robotics Engineer, where I specialized in designing robotic systems and components using Autodesk Inventor, fabricating them with 3D printers, and assembling complex robotic systems. Over the past 3+ years, I transitioned into Data Engineering, focusing on leveraging the Abinitio tool to design and implement data transformation processes, gaining deep expertise in data flow management and optimization. My diverse background enables me to bridge the gap between engineering innovation and data-driven insights.
